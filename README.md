# Developing Data Products Coursera Project
This page hosts the files necessary for the ui.R and server.R file I used to create the Shiny app I created to calculate Long Term Care Costs by agency type. 

Here are the directions to use the app:

* The dataset for the app includes a representitive sample of 6639 patients in the United States who received home health or hospice care from an agency. 

* Simply select the filters you want to see and the app will generate a histogram of the total amount paid by the patient count. The filters availiable to be selected are as follows: 
 + Home Health or Hospice Patient
 + Specialized or Non-Specialized Agency
 + For Profit or Not-For-Profit Status
 + Chain Agency or Not A Chain Agency
 
* In addition, the app will calculate the average cost per patient and the number of patients for the filters you have selected.

Thank you! I hope you have fun evaluating my work. :)
